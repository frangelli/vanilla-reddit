> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- I've decided to create the API in Rails to make it more real
- I've tryed to show how you can create good stuff using VanillaJS
- I broke the components into different classes to make easier to mantain
- I've used the styles files ( SCSS ) separated per component
- I've used webpack to build the project and load ES6, SCSS this way we have a robust build system and better local env
- The app uses a lot of events to make the communication easier between components.

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- Learning Framework: No time needed and no FE framework used
- Coding: around 8 hours...
- Debugging: around 1 hour

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- Do not try to create the components by hand and go direct to template engine.

> Did you learn anything new?

- Ohhh yeah... Actually not new... but how to use the basics knowledge not depending on a framework.

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- Yep... I really do.

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

- Of course my frameworks skills... and testing given it's a prototype I did not want to invest time on this.
